# Project 2: gif-tionary
## Background
This project was made as part of a skills bootcamp. The goal was to create an app that:
- Queries at least two APIs.
- Uses the results of the APIs to update the DOM. 
- Allows the user to affect what is displayed through, for example, a filter or search bar.

## Overview
Gif-tionary is an app that lets a user search for a word and get the definition of that word plus a gif related to that word in return. If there is no gif related to the user's search term, a random gif is given instead.

It was built with the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/).

## How to use
Try the app out [here](https://fac26.github.io/gif-tionary/). To get started, just type a word into the search bar and hit "Go".
